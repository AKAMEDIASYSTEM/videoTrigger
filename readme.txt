To use:
* Start Sketch
* Click "Draw"
* Draw polygons. You must "close off" each polygon by clicking on the first point of the polygon (the point with he circle that shows up when you're near it)
* When you're done drawing polygons, click "Draw" again to turn off Draw Mode
* Click "Analyze" to start analyzing incoming video and doing triggers.

For the sound demo, an extra step:
* when you're done drawing polygons, you can drop sound files on each polygon's origin point - it's the point with the square around it.
